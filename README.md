# Project-DSB

Roam USA is a Travel Planner developed with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5 components and with Weather and Route APIs.

## Roam USA

Roam USA is the name of the site. The function of the website will allow the end user to plan a route across America. It will also show what kind of weather to expect at their destination.
